# Agent Gopher üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Agent Based Model framework for Golang ![](https://travis-ci.org/emilyagras/agentGopher.svg?branch=master)

The goal of this project is to make a generic agent based modeling framework in golang. It is/will be heavily inspired by the [Mesa project for Python 3+](https://github.com/projectmesa)

When the project is well underway, it should be generic and complete enough to model:
- [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/mdwhatcott/golife) and
- [Veron Smith's Double Auction Experiment](http://www.econport.org/econport/request?page=man_io_institution_da)

Right now all we have is an incredibly simple front end that responds to clicks, which looks like this:
